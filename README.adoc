= Langchain4j and LocalAI with SQLCoder Model Demo
CÃ©dric Lamalle <https://github.com/cedric-lamalle[@cedric-lamalle]>

Example demonstrating the use of SQL Generation with https://defog.ai/[Defog.ai]'s SQLCoder, passing SQL metadata to the model and executing the resulting query.

CAUTION: This is demo code!

== Technology Stack (buzzwords section)

* https://localai.io/[LocalAI] to serve the model using https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp[llama-cpp] via an OpenAPI compatible ReST api.
* https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/sqlcoder-7B-GGUF[SQLCoder model 7B version] in GGUF format (by https://huggingface.co/TheBloke[TheBloke])
* https://github.com/langchain4j[Langchain4j] to interact with the LocalAI server in a convenient way.
* The good ol' https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] to serve the ReST api for the final user and run the queries with JdbcTemplate.
* Docker Compose to run the PostgreSQL database (Integrated with Spring Boot)
* https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker[Java Faker] to generate test data

== Setup (using Docker)

Download the model in the _models_ folder. I have choosen the `Q5_K_M` version because it had better results than the `Q4_K_M`, doesn't generate useless _table expressions_. This model has less hallucinations too, i.e., inventing columns.

Then start the docker container for LocalAI.

[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir -p models
$ curl -L https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/sqlcoder-7B-GGUF/resolve/main/sqlcoder-7b.Q5_K_M.gguf -o models/sqlcoder-7b.Q5_K_M.gguf
----

Next step is to initialize the database, running it with `docker compose` and import the sales schema:

[source,shell]
----
$ docker compose up -d
$ docker compose cp sales-schema.sql database:/tmp
$ docker compose exec database psql -U sales -f /tmp/sales-schema.sql
----

== Running the application

The application can be run using _Maven Spring Boot Plugin_ or in your preferred IDE.

[TIP]
====
In the first run activate the `initial-load` profile, for instance:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=initial-load
----
====

When the application is running you can interact with the `/api/sql-generation` endpoint.

Example usage:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/sql-generation -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d '{"question": "What are the top 3 regions where we sell products?"}' | jq
[
  {
    "region": "Sul",
    "number_of_sales": 2354
  },
  {
    "region": "Sudeste",
    "number_of_sales": 2204
  },
  {
    "region": "Centroeste",
    "number_of_sales": 1892
  }
]
